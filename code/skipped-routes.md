### Dynamic Route Page Rendering

How can we generate the _villagers/:id_ pages when they're dependent on dynamic data?

```typescript
// Scully output

Pull in data to create additional routes.
No configuration for route "/villagers/:id" found. Skipping
No configuration for route "/fish/:id" found. Skipping
No configuration for route "/insects/:id" found. Skipping
```
